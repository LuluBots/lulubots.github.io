*Robotics Enthusiast | AI Researcher | Sci-Fi Dreamer*

I‚Äôm a passionate robotics researcher from China, currently a senior in Artificial Intelligence at **Beijing Normal University**. My ambition is to become a **full-stack robotics researcher** and write engaging, imaginative **sci-fi stories**. I've had the privilege of collaborating on exciting projects with **Prof. Nancy Pollard** at **Carnegie Mellon University** and have spent a semester at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong** at the **T Stone Robotics Institute**.

I'm currently seeking a **Ph.D. opportunity in robotics** for Fall 2025. If you‚Äôre interested in chatting about robots, AI, or sci-fi, feel free to reach out!
